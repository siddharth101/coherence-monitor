Scripts to calculate correlation in frequency domain between the primary gravitational wave channel (h(t)) and auxiliary channels based on [gwpy.coherence](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/latest/examples/frequencyseries/coherence/). Example [L1 plot](https://ldas-jobs.ligo-la.caltech.edu/~siddharth.soni/scatter_coh_1402836857.png.html), [H1 plot](https://ldas-jobs.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/~siddharth.soni/scatter_coh_1402815257.png.html) showing the value of maximum coherence and the frequency of maximum coherence for each auxiliary channel.
